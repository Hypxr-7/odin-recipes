    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        When I heard New England beach pizza called "America's worst pizza," I knew I had to give it a try. With a thin crust, a very sweet sauce, no toppings but a scant sprinkle of mozzarella and full slices of provolone—well, it does deserve a certain reputation. I admit that it is good in a guilty-pleasure sort of way, and a really fun experiment.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon chilli flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pizza</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>24 ounces pizza dough</li>
        <li>3 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>12 slices provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; sauté garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato paste, and cook, stirring, for another 30 seconds. Add marinara, water, sugar, oregano, and chili flakes. Bring to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes. Taste for seasoning and adjust if need be. Turn off heat and reserve.</li>
        <li>Roll and stretch dough into a rectangle about 15x10 inches. Rub a 13x18-inch half sheet pan with olive oil and transfer dough on. Push, pull, and stretch dough to cover pan. If dough pulls back from the edge, let it rest for a few minutes, and then continue shaping.</li>
        <li>Top dough with a light layer of sauce (the recipe will make extra sauce). Top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is cooked through, and the bottom is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>As soon as pizza comes out of the oven, top with slices of provolone. Pizza can be served immediately, or placed back in the oven for a few minutes to melt provolone even more.</li>
    </ol>

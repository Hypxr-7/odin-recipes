        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) package steam-in-bag green beans</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons softened butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>chopped freshly parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Whisk together lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, oregano, garlic powder, 2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl until well combined. </li>
        <li>Slice chicken in half lengthwise and pound slightly to a uniform thickness  (Alternatively, you can use 6 chicken cutlets), and place chicken in a shallow dish or large resealable bag. Pour half of the olive oil mixture over chicken and toss well to coat. Let chicken marinate 30 minutes while potatoes are prepared.  </li>
        <li>Add potatoes to remaining marinade and toss well. Transfer potatoes to a lightly greased 9x13 baking dish and season with remaining salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are just tender, tossing halfway through, 25 to 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare green beans according to microwave package directions. </li>
        <li>Remove potatoes from the oven and toss green beans with potatoes. Top with dollops of half of the softened butter. Remove chicken from marinade and place on top of potatoes and green beans. Reserve any remaining marinade in the bowl. </li>
        <li>Add remaining butter, mayonnaise, and Parmesan cheese to the bowl with any remaining marinade and mix well. Spread butter mixture over evenly over chicken and return pan to oven. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. If you like your chicken browned, broil on high the last 2 minutes to brown the tops of the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
